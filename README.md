# Getting Started with Light Library

This is my personal React Light Library. With this lib you may be able to use components in your projects simply by importing and using it. You may be able to create a theme with styled-components and have the components looking good in your context.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles all the components with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

### `yarn build storybook`

It builds the storybook for production in `storybook-static` folder.

### `yarn storybook`

Runs the documentation in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### `yarn test`

Runs the tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/).
